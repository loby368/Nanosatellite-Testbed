# Nano-Satellite Project
This project was conducted as part of my master's Thesis in Aerospace Engineering at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm. 

The project aimed to develop a NanoSatellite testbed on which Simulink control algorithms could be tested in a zero-g-like environment.
The hardware consists of a 1U CubeSat with a 1-axis reaction wheel mounted upon an air bearing to provide frictionless rotation.

The project involved designing the system architecture, developing the embedded system avionics units, building the mechanical chassis, and running control algorithm tests.

## Video
You can watch a video of a force feedback control algorithm running on the testbed [here.](https://youtu.be/84-hkJHZbc4)

## Learnings:
From this project, I have improved my skills with:
- C
- STM32
- STMCUBEMX
- STMCUBEIDE
- HAL libraries
- Device drivers and datasheets
- Simulink Embedded Coder
- PID and Wave-Based control algorithms
